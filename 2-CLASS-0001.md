## Option 2: Class 001

### Why 001?

Why would someone choose Class 001 over learning solo? Because **overhead.** 

Next to an inability to touch type, overhead is the *second biggest barrier* to beginners trying to learn to code. So what is it? Overhead is the tasks related to coding that isn't *actual* coding. Here are some examples: 

  * Troubleshooting the many, many technical issues you will encounter trying to setup your coding environments on your computer. This, by far, will make up the majority of your overhead. 
  * Researching which languages or technologies to start learning with (Ruby, Python or Javascript? MySQL, SQL, PostgreSQL?, etc.) 
  * Researching what tools you need to learn to code (and you will often not find the best ones)
  * Researching and experimenting with different books, online courses, materials, the best order in which to use them...
  * Researching coding bootcamps and careers

On their own, absolute beginners will spend more time Googling stuff (that isn't coding) than actually coding. Overhead takes up *most* of a beginner's time - and that, for most people, hurts motivation. Furthermore, most of the 'learning to code' stuff out there is pretty bad and can discourage absolute beginners who just don't know better. I believe that Overhead is why most people quit. 

So if you have coder friends, mentors, or peers willing to help you, your overhead can be greatly reduced. If not, class 001 will eliminate ~95% of your overhead. 


### What is Class 001?

Class 001 is a QUICK evaluator of your **Coding Potential ("CP")**. We can evaluate your **CP** between two weeks to six weeks and then provide you the assessment results - all while teaching you to code. Comparing Class 001 to Coding Bootcamps can help explain what it is  well:

|                                         | Bootcamps | Class 001 |
| --------------------------------------  |:---------:|:---------:|
| Purpose of course/class                 | Get a Dev Job | Fast Validation of Potential |
| Target audience/students | Very smart people | Absolute beginners |
| Curriculum scheduling                   | 3-mo intensive, Fixed | Self-paced, Flexible |
| % Labs (paired or grouped)              | 50% | 50% |
| % Curriculum lectures                   | 30% | 50% |
| % Soft topics (guests, blogs, feelings) | 20% | 0% |
| Outside-of-class pair programming?      | Varies | Yes |
| Tuition                                 | $12,000 ($20/hr rate) | $150/mo. |

## Prerequisites

#### i. Gmail account
[Create a Gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=default). We use Google services in class so Gmail is required. Gmail is a modern, robust, and has strong spam filtering. I recommend these settings:
* General >> Maximum page size = 100
* General >> Keyboard shortcut on
* Forwarding >> Enable IMAP
* Labs >> Enable Undo Send
* Labs >> Enable Unread Message Icon

#### ii. Github account
[create a Github account](https://github.com/). Don't worry about what this is for now. Just know that Github is essentialfor developers. Create one using your Gmail account, if possible. 

Once you create your account, we recommend you go to [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and check "Keep my email address private" at the bottom.

#### iii. Touch Typing
A typical programmer types 80+ WPM. Some bootcamps require 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for 001. An inability to touch type is the first hurdle to overcome in order to code. 

[Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should be able to consistently type 40+ *real WPM* on the test **without** looking at your keyboard. Hereâ€™s how we calculate *real WPM*: 

`(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     

For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

Touch typing is the ability to type without looking, so proper fingering is important. Without good fingering, you'll never reach 80 WPM. Learn fingering here:
* [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
* [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
* [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
* [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
* [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
* [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)

Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your stuff. 

#### iv. Three more requirements (can be done after applying)

* Install *WhatsApp* on your phone. *WhatsApp* is a cross-platform app that will allow the class to group text and chat easily. It is a free app. 
* Any laptop will do for Class 001, however, if it's a Macbook, update OSX to the latest version 10.9.4 if you can. It's free. 
* [Install Google's Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/) browser. It's the standard browser for developers.

## The Application

Sessions are limited and are currently invite only. 

After you've fulfilled the above prerequisites, please set aside 30 minutes to complete the application when you are ready. It usually takes less time than that. 

When you're ready, go [to the application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-VxvIEiTrPFZRQXZwfVRXB1uhxM9fZXfgUiGeKkOoSc/viewform) to complete it. Once I receive your application, I will send you additional setup follow up instructions.  

> **IMPORTANT:** Once you receive the Class 001 stuff, the clock will start ticking on your assessment. So it will be a good idea to jump in and start coding as much as you can. 

The application will gather sensitive information from you. I will use your sensitive data only to provide you an accurate assessment. Once your relationship ends with Brightfence (that is, you stop taking any courses), I will anonymize your sensitive data by scrubbing your personally identifiable information from it, and then aggregate it to my statistics to help me improve my assessment accuracy for future students. Your contact information will be kept isolated, confidential and secure to use for future communications which you can opt out of at any time. 

The Application gets information on your Achievements, Disposition, and Values as they relate to coding success potential. This is pretty heavy stuff, but once you receive the assessment, you'll see the benefits.

## Windows or Mac?

Finally, if you are thinking of purchasing a new laptop now or plan to continue learning to code beyond Class 001, you'll need a Mac. Windows computers are fine if you plan to be a developer in corporate finance, corporate healthcare or the Windows platform ecosystem. But if you want to work in any startup or develop any web app or develop any mobile app, Windows is the wrong tool. Trying to use Windows to develop a web app is like trying to use a hammer to screw things together. 

If you're not convinced, read on...

In Class 001, all computers are allowed because we're all going to use the same Virtual Linux environment to code in. But when you advance to a professional work environment, Windows will add a magnitude of order more overhead to an already challenging learning process. As the only one with a Windows machine, you will fall behind every other student, at best. Or you will drag the entire class behind with you, at worst. 

All modern web and mobile developers work on a Mac now - so the developer community, the idioms, the how-to guides, the troubleshooting help are all for Macs. So when you encounter hundreds of unique technical problems - configuration issues, package management issues, etc - **NO ONE will be able to help you.** That includes teachers. You'll be 100% on your own. I can't emphasize enough how terrible this technical isolation is to the learning experience. 

If you don't like Apple for, say, sentimental reasons and are still not swayed, consider this: 

1. Every coding bootcamps requires Macs and won't accept windows.
2. Googlers hate Apple but they *all* use Macs for development anyway. 
3. Same as above for most Android developers.

Notice a pattern? There is a very good reason developers use Macs. Here's some more food for thought:

1. If, at an interview for a junior dev position, you mention your feelings about Macs, you will raise big red flags and not get hired
1. If, at an interview, you admit you don't know how to develop on a Mac, it will be a strike against you
1. If you reject Macs for development due to anti-Mac sentiments, you will be marked instantly as a pretender or newbie by other developers. 
 
You see, Consumers can afford to make emotion-based choices. Developers, on the other hand, don't have that luxury. Religious zeal for or against any platform is very un-developer-like. As a developer, it's in your rational best interest to be **platform agnostic** and just go with whatever tool works the best for that particular function - like Google, Android, or every modern start up and app developer out there. It should be clear by now that *developers don't think like consumers.* 

Why is that? 

Well, it's because developers are engineers, and engineers are a different breed of people whose choices are driven by logic and reasoning more than other other kind of people on earth. They work so intimately with *a medium of pure logic* that they sort of can't help thinking this way. 

So developers make super-practical, Spock-like choices from the farthest (logical) end of the spectrum while consumers make choices from the other end (emotion and sentiment). Developers use whatever tool that allows them to build the best products they can the fastest. If Blackberry came out with a laptop that was clearly the best development tool tomorrow, Developers would flock to it immediately. They are logical, practical and agnostic. 

And so. Your first lesson in coding is this:
```
Think like a developer, not like a consumer.
```

The two are a world apart.
