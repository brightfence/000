## Option 1: On Your Own

Learning on your own is certainly a viable (and budget friendly) option. Here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin on your own. 

1. [Flatiron's pre-work](http://prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

2. [App Academy's prep work](http://github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

4. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

5. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers who are super helpful. You post coding questions and you will often receive answers back within an hour. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

6. Touch type 40+ WPM. A typical seasoned programmer types 80+ WPM. *App Academy* requires 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for our classes. The inability to touch type is the single, greatest hurdle to first overcome for anyone who wants to learn to code. 

   [Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should be able to consistently type 40+ *real WPM* on the test **without** looking at your keyboard. Hereâ€™s how we calculate *real WPM*:   `(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

   You should also score at least 30 real WPM on [this alpha numberic test](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php). It's much harder, but it's important since coding requires typing numbers and special characters. 

   Since touch typing is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard, proper fingering becomes very important. You may be able to hit 40 WPM with improper fingering, but you won't be able to do 80 WPM without correct fingering. Here are some places to learn:
  * [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
  * [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
  * [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
  * [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
  * [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
  * [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)

   Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your important stuff. 

That's it. While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula take hundreds of hours *each*).
