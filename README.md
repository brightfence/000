Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are looking forward to continuing your lessons. There are two paths you can take to continue your education: **on your own** or **with Brightfence**. We'll go through both options below.

# Option 1: On Your Own

Modern advances in coding education have made it easier than ever to learn to code on your own. As we've promised, here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin. 

1. [Chris Pine's book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). Chris Pine kindly puts up the first half of his book for free online and, in our opinion, this is the single best resource for absolute beginners learning to code. Though it suddenly increases in difficulty in the latter chapters, the first 8 or 9 chapters' pacing is excellent. You can also purchase the full book [here](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404839087&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+pine+learn+to+program).

2. [Flatiron's pre-work](prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [App Academy's prep work](github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

4. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

5. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

6. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers - and lots of Rubyists! -  who are incentivized to help each other. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

7. [Touch typing test](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). Knowing how to type is a strong requirement for coding. You should type 40+ *“real WPM"* on the test without looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate "real WPM": 
`(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

And that's it! While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula will take hundreds of hours *each*). 



# Option 2: With BrightFence

### Why 001

If you are more productive in a structured group setting, you might want to try our 001 class. In 001, we're trying to create a uniquely awesome classroom experience by trying to solve a major problem endemic to schools. 

First, some background. All schools share a bell curve problem. This is where, in any given class, student ability naturally spreads out into a [bell-shaped curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve). Those to the right (ahead) of the curve will get increasingly frustrated at the slow pace while those to the left slip farther and farther behind. For the latter group it's especially tough: the frustration and discouragement either build up into full-blown panic or deflate into detachment. It's a huge headache for educators and teachers. 

With 001, we're taking a big swing at this problem. We're attempting to make it so that your pace in relation to other students **won't matter**. You set your own pace and go while retaining the benefits of a classroom setting. Here are the five ways we are innovating to solve this: 

1. 001 is designed not to waste time. It's purpose is to quickly evaluate and validate a student's **Minimum Potential Ability Coding"** (MPAC) *while* teaching her how to code. We can determine your MPAC within two months (sometimes within one). This laser focus removes a lot of overhead filler from the classroom. 
2. Classes are mainly labs. Students can request short lectures on particular curriculum topics, but students will mainly work in pairs and with TAs to learn to code by actually coding. And these labs are all self paced! 
3. Classes are not locked into any linear structure. In other words, you learn what you need to learn *when* you need to learn it, no matter which class you sit in. Classes are designed for maximum flexibility. 
4. Classes are *a la carte*. A lot of students have inflexible schedules and we don't want to penalize them. And so, students will be able to pay on a per-class basis and pay for just those classes they can attend. This is by far the fairest pricing model we came up with - in fact, we can't think a fairer model! 
5. TAs are an expensive luxury. Most schools cannot afford them. However, TAs are extremely helpful - especially in lab settings. TAs typically comprise between 0% to 5% of a classroom body, maxing out at around 10% at places like coding bootcamps. With 001, we've decided to invest heavily in the TA body to the tune of a **30% classroom makeup**! That's taking the highest % makeup in today's market, and then *tripling* it! 

To accomplish the above lofty goals, **001** has been created as *premium* product. Due to our minimum TA requirements, classes will have tightly limited seats and will be on a first-reserve, first-serve basis. We suggest applying to reserve a seat sooner than later. :)
