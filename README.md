## Class 000's next steps kit

Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are now motivated enough to start learning to code!

There are two paths you can take to continue your education: **on your own** or **with Brightfence**. We'll go through both options below. 

**Tip**: Hold down `CMD` (Mac) or `CTRL` (Windows) to click open a link in a new window.

<br>
## Option 1: On Your Own

Learning on your own is certainly a viable (and budget friendly) option. Here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin on your own. 

1. [Flatiron's pre-work](http://prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

2. [App Academy's prep work](http://github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

4. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

5. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers who are super helpful. You post coding questions and you will often receive answers back within an hour. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

6. Touch type 40+ WPM. A typical seasoned programmer types 80+ WPM. *App Academy* requires 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for our classes. The inability to touch type is the single, greatest hurdle to first overcome for anyone who wants to learn to code. 

   [Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should be able to consistently type 40+ *real WPM* on the test **without** looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate *real WPM*:   `(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

   You should also score at least 30 real WPM on [this alpha numberic test](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php). It's much harder, but it's important since coding requires typing numbers and special characters. 

   Since touch typing is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard, proper fingering becomes very important. You may be able to hit 40 WPM with improper fingering, but you won't be able to do 80 WPM without correct fingering. Here are some places to learn:
  * [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
  * [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
  * [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
  * [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
  * [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
  * [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)

   Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your important stuff. 

That's it. While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula take hundreds of hours *each*).

## Option 2: BrightFence's Class 001

### The "Overhead" Problem

Why would you want to study with us rather than solo? Because **overhead.** 

Next to an inability to touch type, overhead is the *second biggest barrier* to beginners trying to learn to code. So what is it? Overhead is the tasks related to coding that isn't *actual* coding. Here are some examples: 

  * Troubleshooting the many, many technical issues you will encounter trying to setup your coding environments on your computer. This, by far, will make up the majority of your overhead. 
  * Researching which languages or technologies to start learning with (Ruby, Python or Javascript? MySQL, SQL, PostgreSQL?, etc.) 
  * Researching what tools you need to learn to code (and you will often not find the best ones)
  * Researching and experimenting with different books, online courses, materials, the best order in which to use them...
  * Researching coding bootcamps and careers

On their own, absolute beginners will spend more time Googling stuff (that isn't coding) than actually coding. Overhead takes up *most* of a beginner's time - and that, for most people, hurts motivation. Furthermore, most of the 'learning to code' stuff out there is pretty bad and can discourage absolute beginners who just don't know better. I believe that Overhead is why most people quit. 

So if you have coder friends, mentors, or peers willing to help you, your overhead can be greatly reduced. If not, class 001 will eliminate ~95% of your overhead.

### What is Class 001?

Class 001 is a QUICK evaluator of your **Coding Potential ("CP")**. We can evaluate your **CP** between two weeks to six weeks - all while teaching you to code. Class 001 is designed

1. To minimize "soft" topics and laser focus on coding
2. To minimize overhead
3. To be flexible (everyone goes at their own pace)
4. To be affordable ($150/month)
5. To provide an accurate CP assessment at the end

Sessions are limited and are reserved on a first-come basis. [You can fill out our application to reserve a seat here](https://docs.google.com/a/brightfence.com/forms/d/1ZjKQrw9N6Qi2XOmhc38Vj_wX4Jk-Nrc5c1_67UTDO7M/viewform) after you fulfill the requirements below. 

**Please note**: The application takes 15 to 30 minutes to complete.



### Three requirements before applying

#### i. Gmail account
[Create a Gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=default). We use a lot of Google services in the class so Gmail is required. On the plus side, if you don't use Gmail, it's a good time to modernize. Gmail is the most modern, robust, and safe mainstream email system out there. Some code bootcamps require Gmail as well. On Gmail, we recommend these settings:
* General >> Maximum page size = 100
* General >> Keyboard shortcut on
* Forwarding >> Enable IMAP
* Forwarding >> Auto Expunge OFF
* Forwarding >> Move messages to Trash
* Labs >> Enable Undo Send
* Labs >> Enable Unread Message Icon

#### ii. Github account
[create a Github account](https://github.com/). Don't worry about what this is for now. Just know that Github is essential  for developers. Create one using your Gmail account, if possible. 

Once you create your account, we recommend you go to [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and check "Keep my email address private" at the bottom.

#### iii. Touch Typing
A typical seasoned programmer types 80+ WPM. Some bootcamps require 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for 001. An inability to touch type is the single, greatest hurdle that must be first overcome to learn to code. 

[Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should be able to consistently type 40+ *real WPM* on the test **without** looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate *real WPM*: 
`(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

You should also score at least 30 real WPM on [this alpha numberic test](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php). It's much harder, but it's important since coding requires typing numbers and special characters. 

Since touch typing is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard, proper fingering is also very important. You may be able to hit 40 WPM with improper fingering, but you won't be able to do 80 WPM without correct fingering. So here are some places to learn:
* [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
* [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
* [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
* [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
* [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
* [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)

Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your important stuff. 

#### iv. Three more requirements (can be done after applying)

* Install *WhatsApp* on your phone. *WhatsApp* is a cross-platform app that will allow the class to group text and chat easily. It is a free app. 
* Any laptop will do for Class 001, however, if it's a Macbook, update OSX to the latest version 10.9.4 if you can. It's free. 
* [Install Google's Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/) browser. It's the standard browser for developers.

## The Application
Please fill out [this application](https://docs.google.com/a/brightfence.com/forms/d/1ZjKQrw9N6Qi2XOmhc38Vj_wX4Jk-Nrc5c1_67UTDO7M/viewform) **after** you've fulfilled the first three requirements above. Once we receive your application, we will send you more details about 001. 

The application will gather sensitive information from you. I will use your sensitive data only to provide you an accurate assessment. Once your relationship ends with Brightfence (that is, you stop taking any courses), I will anonymize your sensitive data by scrubbing your personally identifiable information from it, and then aggregate it to my statistics to help me improve my assessment accuracy for future students. Your contact information will be kept isolated, confidential and secure to use for future communications which you can opt out of at any time. 

The Application gets information on your Achievements, Disposition, and Values as they relate to coding success potential. This is pretty heavy stuff, but once you receive the assessment, you'll see the benefits.

## A couple of things


### Class 001 vs. bootcamps

I get asked this so I wanted to clarify that Class 001 is not a "coding bootcamp." Here is a comparison chart that outlines the difference:

|                                         | Bootcamps | Class 001 |
| --------------------------------------  |:---------:|:---------:|
| Purpose of course/class                 | Get a Dev Job | Fast Validation of Potential |
| Target audience/students | Very smart people | Absolute beginners |
| Curriculum scheduling                   | 3-mo intensive, Fixed | Self-paced, Flexible |
| % Labs (paired or grouped)              | 50% | 90% |
| % Curriculum lectures                   | 30% | 10% |
| % Soft topics (guests, blogs, emotional health) | 20% | 0% |
| Outside-of-class pair programming?      | Varies | Yes |
| Tuition                                 | $12,000 ($20/hr rate) | $150/mo. |


### Windows or Mac?

Finally, if you are thinking of purchasing a new laptop now or plan to continue learning to code beyond Class 001, you'll need a Mac. Windows computers are fine if you plan to be a developer in corporate finance, corporate healthcare or the Windows platform ecosystem. But if you want to work in any startup or develop any web app or develop any mobile app, Windows is the wrong tool. Trying to use Windows to develop a web app is like trying to use a hammer to screw things together. 

If you're not convinced, read on...

In Class 001, all computers are allowed because we're all going to use the same Virtual Linux environment to code in. But when you advance to a professional work environment, Windows will add a magnitude of order more overhead and frustration to an already challenging learning process. As the only one with a Windows machine, you will fall behind every other student, at best. Or you will drag the entire class behind with you, at worst. 

All modern web and mobile developers work on a Mac now - so the developer community, the idioms, the how-to guides, the troubleshooting help are all for Macs. So when you come across the hundreds of unique technical problems - configuration issues, package management issues, etc - **NO ONE will be able to help you.** That includes teachers. You'll be 100% on your own. I can't emphasize enough how terrible this is to the learning experience. 

If you don't like Apple for, say, sentimental reasons and are not swayed, consider these facts: 

1. Every coding bootcamps requires Macs and won't accept windows.
2. Googlers hate Apple but they *all* use Macs for development anyway. 
3. Android developers are the same as Google developers.

Notice a pattern? It would be safe to say that there is a very, very good reason developers use Macs. Here's some more food for thought:

1. If, at an interview for a junior dev position, you mention your feelings about Macs, you will raise big red flags and not get hired
1. If, at an interview, you admit you don't know how to develop on a Mac, it will be a strike against you
1. If you talk to other modern developers about anti-Macs sentiment with regards to development, you will be marked instantly as a pretender or a  newbie. You can have such sentiments while you wear your consumer hat, but definitely not when you put on your developer hat. 

You see, Consumers can afford to be fanboys. Developers don't have that luxury. Religious zeal for or against any platform is very un-developer-like. As a developer, it's in your rational best interest to be like Google, Android, or every modern start up and app developer out there and be **platform agnostic.** 

And why is this? 

Well, it's because *developers don't think like consumers.* They  are engineers; and engineers are a different breed of humans whose choices are driven by logic and reasoning more than other other kind of people on earth. And this is because they work intimately in *a language and medium of pure logic* - so they sort of can't help it. 

So developers make Spock-like choices from the farthest (logical) end of the spectrum while consumers make choices from the other end (emotion and sentiment). 

Developers are therefore hyper-practical and will use whatever tool that allows them to build the best products they can the fastest. If Blackberry came out with a laptop that was clearly the best development tool tomorrow, Developers would flock to it immediately. They are logical, objective and agnostic. 

And so. The first lesson in coding is this:
```
Start to think like a developer, not like a consumer.
```

The two are a world apart.
