Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are looking forward to continuing your lessons. There are two paths you can take to continue your education: on your own or with Brightfence. We'll go through both options below. 

# Option 1: On Your Own

Modern advances in coding education has made it easier than ever to learn to code on your own. As we've promised, here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you learn to code on your own. 

1. [Chris Pine's book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). This is the 

2. [Flatiron's pre-work](prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! 

3. [App Academy's prep work](github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. 

4. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

5. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

6. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers - and lots of Rubyists! -  who are incentivized to help each other. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

7. [Touch typing](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). Knowing how to type is a strong requirement for coding. You should type 40+ *“real WPM"* on this test without looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate "real WPM": 
`Your raw WPM * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

And that's it! While the list seems scant, it's actually hundreds of hours of work - especially Flatiron's and App Academy's prework.
