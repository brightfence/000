## Class Zero (000) next steps kit
Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are looking forward to continuing your lessons. There are two paths you can take to continue your education: **on your own** or **with Brightfence**. We'll go through both options below.

# Option 1: On Your Own
Modern advances in coding education have made it easier than ever to learn to code on your own. As we've promised, here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin. 

1. [Chris Pine's book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). Chris Pine kindly puts up the first half of his book for free online and, in our opinion, this is the single best resource for absolute beginners learning to code. Though it suddenly increases in difficulty in the latter chapters, the first 8 or 9 chapters' pacing is excellent. You can also purchase the full book [here](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404839087&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+pine+learn+to+program).

2. [Flatiron's pre-work](prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [App Academy's prep work](github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

4. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

5. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

6. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers - and lots of Rubyists! -  who are incentivized to help each other. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

7. Touch type 40+ WPM. 
   A typical seasoned programmer types 80+ WPM. App Academy requires 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for 001. The inability to touch type is the single, greatest hurdle to first overcome for anyone who wants to learn to code. 

   [Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should type 40+ *real WPM* on the test without looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate *real WPM*:  `(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

   You should also score at least 30 real WPM on [this alpha numberic test](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php). It's much harder, but it's important since coding requires typing numbers and special characters. 

   Since touch typing is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard, proper fingering becomes very important. You may be able to hit 40 WPM with improper fingering, but you won't be able to do 80 WPM without correct fingering. Here are some places to learn:
  * [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
  * [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
  * [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
  * [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
  * [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
  * [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)


   Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your important stuff. 


And that's it! While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula will take hundreds of hours *each*). 


# Option 2: Class 001

### Why 001
If you are more productive in a structured group setting, you might want to try our 001 class. In 001, it's all about flexibility. We try to create a uniquely awesome, flexible classroom experience with the following:

1. 001 is designed not to waste time. It's purpose is to quickly evaluate and validate a student's **Minimum Potential Ability to Code"** (MPAC) *while* teaching her how to code. We can determine your MPAC within two months (sometimes within one). This laser focus removes a lot of overhead time fillers from the classroom. 

2. Classes are mainly labs. Students can request short lectures on particular curriculum topics, but students will mainly work in pairs and with TAs to learn to code by actually coding. 

3. Classes are not locked into any linear structure. In other words, you learn what you need to learn *when* you need to learn it, no matter which class you sit in. We eschew rigid schedule to maximize flexibility. 

4. Classes are *a la carte*. A lot of students have inflexible schedules and have to pay for class whether they attend or not. Not only do they fall behind, but they get penalized for their schedules. At BrightFence, we wondered what was the absolute fairest payment model we can imagine, and here it is: In 001, students will pay *only for the days they attend*. We couldn't think of a fairer, awesomer payment model - can you? 

Sessions will have limited seats and can be reserved on a first-come basis. [Apply to reserve a seat](https://docs.google.com/a/brightfence.com/forms/d/1ZjKQrw9N6Qi2XOmhc38Vj_wX4Jk-Nrc5c1_67UTDO7M/viewform) as soon as you fulfill the requirements below.


### Three requirements before applying

#### i. Github account
[create a Github account](https://github.com/). Don't worry about what this is for now. Just know that having a Github account is practically a requirement in the world of programmers and developers. So create one. We'll be sharing everyone's Github accounts in class, so don't create a username that might embarrass you. 

Once you create your account, we recommend you go to [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and check "Keep my email address private" at the bottom. 

#### ii. Gmail account
[Create a Gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=default). We use a lot of Google services in the class so Gmail is required. On the plus side, if you don't use Gmail, it's a good time to modernize. Gmail is the most modern, robust, and safe mainstream email system out there. Some code bootcamps require Gmail as well. On Gmail, we recommend these settings:
* General >> Maximum page size = 100
* General >> Keyboard shortcut on
* Forwarding >> Enable IMAP
* Forwarding >> Auto Expunge OFF
* Forwarding >> Move messages to Trash
* Labs >> Enable Undo Send
* Labs >> Enable Unread Message Icon

#### Two more quick things (can be done after applying): 
* Any laptop will do, however, if it's a Macbook, update OSX to the latest version 10.9.4 if you can. It's free. 
* [Install Google's Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/) browser. It's the best and the standard browser for developers.  


### Apply here
