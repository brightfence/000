Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are looking forward to continuing your lessons. There are two paths you can take to continue your education: **on your own** or **with Brightfence**. We'll go through both options below.

# Option 1: On Your Own

Modern advances in coding education have made it easier than ever to learn to code on your own. As we've promised, here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin. 

1. [Chris Pine's book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). Chris Pine kindly puts up the first half of his book for free online and, in our opinion, this is the single best resource for absolute beginners learning to code. Though it suddenly increases in difficulty in the latter chapters, the first 8 or 9 chapters' pacing is excellent. You can also purchase the full book [here](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404839087&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+pine+learn+to+program).

2. [Flatiron's pre-work](prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [App Academy's prep work](github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

4. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

5. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

6. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers - and lots of Rubyists! -  who are incentivized to help each other. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

7. [Touch typing test](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). Knowing how to type is a strong requirement for coding. You should type 40+ *“real WPM"* on the test without looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate "real WPM": 
`(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

And that's it! While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula will take hundreds of hours *each*). 



# Option 2: With BrightFence

If you are more productive in a structured group setting, you might want to join our 001 class. In 001, we try to solve a major problem endemic to schools to create a uniquely awesome experience. 

All Schools have a major problem that they have yet solved: the bell curve. In every class across the world, student ability naturally spreads out into a bell curve. Those ahead of the curve become frustrated at the pace that's too slow. And the problem hits students behind the curve even harder: as they slip farther and farther behind, frustration either builds up into panic or deflates into discouragement and eventually detachment. That's what happens all across the world. 

At BrightFence, we're taking a big swing at this problem so that your pace in relation to other students **won't matter**. You set and go at your own pace. Here's how we're doing it: 

* 001 is designed not to waste time. It's purpose is to quickly evaluate and validate a student's **Minimum Potential Ability Coding"** (MPAC) *while* teaching her how to code. We can determine your MPAC within two months (sometimes within one).
* A la carte model 
* At your own pace model
* An unheard of 50% in-class student to Teacher's Assistant (TA) ratio

To accomplish the above lofty goals, we created a premium course offering we call **001.**  Due to our minimum TA requirements, classes will have tightly limited seats and will be on a first-reserve, first-serve basis. Applying to reserve a seat sooner than later. :)
