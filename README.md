## Class Zero (000) next steps kit
Congratulations on completing class zero! We hope you enjoyed the class and are looking forward to continuing your lessons. There are two paths you can take to continue your education: **on your own** or **with Brightfence**. We'll go through both options below. 

Tip: Hold down `CMD` (Mac) or `CTRL` (Windows) to click open a link in a new window.

# Option 1: On Your Own
Modern advances in coding education have made it easier than ever to learn to code on your own. As we've promised, here is a curated list of our favorite resources to help you begin. 

1. [Flatiron's pre-work](prework.flatironschool.com). This is one of the top three coding bootcamps in the city and they've published the prework they require of their students. If you can get through all of this twice - you just might have what it takes to get into Flatiron! This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

2. [App Academy's prep work](github.com/appacademy/prep-work). This is App Academy's prep work. Parts of it is echoed in Flatiron's. It's worth doing both Flatiron's and App Academy's. This is a Ruby-based curriculum.

3. [How to count](http://www.amazon.com/How-Count-Programming-Mere-Mortals-ebook/dp/B005DPIKPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403837433&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+count). This book is a great intro on computer science concepts in layman's terms. It's a quick read and only $2.99. 

4. [Google](http://google.com/). This may seem silly, but Google is indispensable when learning to code. Programmers don't know everything about everything. In fact, much of the time spent 'coding' is actually looking things up on Google. For this reason, the ability to resourcefully work through a series of frustrating problems is, in our opinion, the single most important skill you will need to master. Google isn't just a coder's friend - it's her lifeline.

5. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Stackoverflow is a community of developers and engineers - and lots of Rubyists! -  who are incentivized to help each other. As a beginner, 99% of the questions you will have will already be answered on Stackoverflow. Like Google, Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource for programmers. 

6. Touch type 40+ WPM. 
   A typical seasoned programmer types 80+ WPM. App Academy requires 60+ WPM. We require 40+ real WPM for 001. The inability to touch type is the single, greatest hurdle to first overcome for anyone who wants to learn to code. 

   [Test your typing here](http://touchtype.co/index.php/typing/tests/41). You should be able to consistently type 40+ *real WPM* on the test **without** looking at your keyboard. Here’s how we calculate *real WPM*:   `(Your raw WPM) * (% accuracy * % accuracy)`     For example:  `51 * (0.95 * 0.95)` = 46

   You should also score at least 30 real WPM on [this alpha numberic test](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed_alpha_numeric.php). It's much harder, but it's important since coding requires typing numbers and special characters. 

   Since touch typing is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard, proper fingering becomes very important. You may be able to hit 40 WPM with improper fingering, but you won't be able to do 80 WPM without correct fingering. Here are some places to learn:
  * [For fingering: wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Touch-Type)
  * [Keybr is nice](http://www.keybr.com/)
  * [Big brown bear](http://bigbrownbear.co.uk/learntotype/)
  * [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html)
  * [Typeonline](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php)
  * [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/tutor/)

   Alternatively, you can practice by transcribing your hand-written stuff (like journals, diaries, letters, papers, etc.) into Word or Text files. This allows you to practice AND digitally archive your important stuff. 

And that's it! While the list doesn't seem exhaustive, it will actually keep you busy for months (Flatiron and App Academy's curricula will take hundreds of hours *each*).

# Option 2: Class 001

### Why 001
Why would you want to study with us rather than solo? The answer is **"overhead."** Overhead is the biggest barrier to beginners to coding - and it's massive. 

But what exactly is **overhead**? 

It's the tasks related to the coding that isn't *actual* coding. Here are some examples:

  * troubleshooting the many, many technical problems you will encounter with setup
  * researching which language to start learning with
  * finding all the tools you need to learn to code (you will often not find the best ones)
  * researching and experimenting with different books, online courses and materials
  * experimenting with the best order in which to learn all your stuff
  * researching the coding bootcamp that's best for you...
  * researching coding careers

Overhead easily takes up *most* of a beginner's time - and that, for most people, cripples motivation. Add to this the fact that most of the 'learning to code' stuff is terrible for absolute beginners and motivation effectively dies. Overhead is why most people quit. 

Brightfence eliminates 99% of the overhead. 

We start with Class 001. 

Class 001 is a QUICK evaluator of potential. It evaluates what we call your **Coding Potential" (CP)** within a month - all while teaching you to code. Class 001 is designed

1. To minimize "soft" topics and laser focus on coding and evaluating
2. To extremely be flexible (everyone goes at their own pace and class scheduling is super flexible)
3. To be affordable (it starts at $100).
4. To provide you with an accurate assessment of your potential, and guidance based on your results.

Sessions are limited and are reserved on a first-come basis. [Apply to reserve a seat](https://docs.google.com/a/brightfence.com/forms/d/1ZjKQrw9N6Qi2XOmhc38Vj_wX4Jk-Nrc5c1_67UTDO7M/viewform) as soon as you fulfill the requirements below.



### Three requirements before applying

#### i. Gmail account
[Create a Gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=default). We use a lot of Google services in the class so Gmail is required. On the plus side, if you don't use Gmail, it's a good time to modernize. Gmail is the most modern, robust, and safe mainstream email system out there. Some code bootcamps require Gmail as well. On Gmail, we recommend these settings:
* General >> Maximum page size = 100
* General >> Keyboard shortcut on
* Forwarding >> Enable IMAP
* Forwarding >> Auto Expunge OFF
* Forwarding >> Move messages to Trash
* Labs >> Enable Undo Send
* Labs >> Enable Unread Message Icon

#### ii. Github account
[create a Github account](https://github.com/). Don't worry about what this is for now. Just know that Github is essential  for developers. Create one using your Gmail account, if possible. 

Once you create your account, we recommend you go to [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) and check "Keep my email address private" at the bottom.

#### iv. Two more quick things (can be done after applying): 
* Any laptop will do, however, if it's a Macbook, update OSX to the latest version 10.9.4 if you can. It's free. 
* [Install Google's Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/) browser. It's the best and the standard browser for developers.  


### Apply here
Please fill out [this application](https://docs.google.com/a/brightfence.com/forms/d/1ZjKQrw9N6Qi2XOmhc38Vj_wX4Jk-Nrc5c1_67UTDO7M/viewform) **after** you've fulfilled the first three requirements above. Scheduling will be determined by the applicants' free times. Once we receive your application, we will send you full pricing and scheduling information. 


### Class 001 is not a Bootcamp
On a final note, we are not a bootcamp. To clarify what we are, here is a comparison chart:

|                                         | Bootcamps | Class 001 |
| --------------------------------------  |:---------:|:---------:|
| Purpose of course/class                 | Get a Dev Job | Fast Validation of Potential |
| Curriculum scheduling                   | 3-mo intensive, Fixed | Self-paced, Flexible |
| Tuition cost structure                  | Conventional upfront $20/hr rate | $100/month + a la carte per session |
| % Labs (paired or grouped)              | 50% | 50% |
| % Curriculum lectures                   | 30% | 50% |
| % Soft topics (guests, blogs, emotions) | 20% | 0% |
| School lab open hours                   | 24/7 | TBD |
| Outside-of-class pair programming?      | Varies | Yes |
